# Miraz's Solution — Smart Waste Sorter (Demo)

This is a ready-to-run Streamlit app that suggests a waste disposal category from an uploaded image or short description.
It's a lightweight **demo** that uses keyword mapping (no heavy ML), so it runs quickly and is easy to deploy.

## What's inside
- `app.py` — Streamlit app
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## How you can use it (no coding if you deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces)
### Option A — Run locally (quick)
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open a terminal and `cd` into the project folder.
3. (Optional) create & activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows PowerShell:
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # macOS / Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
6. The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Option B — Deploy and share (no-code, recommended)
You can deploy the app to **Streamlit Community Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces**. Both provide a public URL you can share.

#### Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud (easiest)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the project (see below).
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and sign in with GitHub.
3. Click **Create app**, select your GitHub repo, branch `main`, and `app.py` as the file.
4. Deploy — after a few minutes you'll get a shareable URL.

#### Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit)
1. Create a Hugging Face account at https://huggingface.co/.
2. Create a new **Space**, choose the **Streamlit** SDK.
3. Upload `app.py` and `requirements.txt` (or push via Git).
4. The Space will build and give a public URL.

## If you want me to fully deploy for you
I cannot deploy to external hosting without access to your GitHub/Hugging Face account. If you want me to *create and deploy* the Space or repo for you, you can:
- Provide a GitHub repository URL where I can push (or)
- Create the repo yourself and give me permission (or)
- Follow the 3–4 clicks above — it's fast and painless.

## Next steps (optional improvements)
- Replace keyword mapping with a fine-tuned image model for local waste streams.
- Add language translations (Bangla).
- Add a correction button to collect labeled examples from users.
