# Miraz's Solution — Premium (ready-to-deploy)

This project is a polished, mobile-friendly Streamlit demo for a Smart Waste Sorter.
Files included:
- `app.py` (main app)
- `requirements.txt`
- `.streamlit/config.toml`
- `assets/icons/*.png` (logo and category icons)

## Minimal steps to make it live (zero coding)

### Option A — Upload via GitHub web (recommended if you're new)
1. Go to https://github.com and create a **new repository** (example name: `miraz-solution`).
2. Open your new repository page on GitHub.
3. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**.
4. Drag and drop **all files and folders** from this project (including the `.streamlit` folder and `assets` folder). You can also upload the zip content by unzipping locally first.
5. Scroll down and click **Commit changes** (green button).
6. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and **Sign in with GitHub**.
7. Click **New app** → choose your GitHub repo (`yourusername/miraz-solution`) → Branch: `main` → Main file path: `app.py` → Click **Deploy**.
8. Wait 1–3 minutes. Your app URL will appear and is shareable.

### Option B — Push using Git (if you have Git installed)
```bash
cd /path/to/unzipped/project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add Miraz's Solution premium app"
# create a GitHub repo and copy the 'git remote add' command shown on GitHub,
# or run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing, create a new Streamlit app on https://share.streamlit.io and select this repo (same steps as above). Streamlit will auto-build and run.

## If you need me to push for you
I cannot push to your GitHub or Streamlit account. If you'd like, create the empty GitHub repo and give me the repo URL; I will generate the exact `git` commands you need to run locally to push (copy-paste).

Enjoy your new premium-looking Miraz's Solution app!
